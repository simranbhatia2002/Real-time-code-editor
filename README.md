Project Title: Real-time Code Editor

## GitHub Repository:

https://github.com/simranbhatia2002/Real-time-code-editor

## Project Overview:

The Real-time Code Editor is a collaborative coding platform that allows multiple users to write, edit, and execute code simultaneously in real time. It supports live syncing across connected clients and remote code execution using a third-party API (JDoodle).

This project is designed to mimic the experience of working in a collaborative coding environment, such as pair programming or interview practice platforms.

## Tech Stack:

_Frontend:_ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

_Backend:_ Node.js, Express.js

_Real-time Communication:_ Socket.IO

_Code Execution API:_ JDoodle API

## My Contributions:

- Set up and configured WebSocket communication using Socket.IO to enable real-time collaboration.

- Integrated the JDoodle API for compiling and running code on the backend.

- Built the entire backend logic using Node.js and Express to manage user sessions, rooms, and communication.

- Designed the editor interface using basic frontend technologies with syntax highlighting support.

## Implemented features like:

- Room creation and joining

- Synchronized code changes across clients

- Server-based code execution and result display

## What Makes It Stand Out:

- Built from scratch without relying on advanced libraries or pre-made editors like Monaco.

- Real-time syncing is stable and works across multiple devices.

- Demonstrates practical knowledge of backend systems, APIs, and WebSocket events.

-Simulates a collaborative coding platform with compile-and-run functionality.
